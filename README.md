## Rel

### Description

### Installation

To install the CLI tool, you can use the `curl` command to download and execute the installation script directly from the GitHub repository. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yamayamaaya/Rel/master/install.sh | bash
```

This command will download the install.sh script and execute it, which will then download the actual CLI tool, make it executable, and move it to a directory in your PATH, allowing you to run the tool from anywhere.
